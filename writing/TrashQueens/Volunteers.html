ugh. <br />
this world is so full of trash.<br />
money makes things so difficult.<br />
band aid solutions are everywhere<br />
but parts of our system are broken and bleeding.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
i want to think that big systems can work<br />
that we can take a summative approach to knowledge<br />
stand on the shoulders of giants<br />
but all these creatures keep shoving each other down <br />
and everyone's knees are skinned. <br />
  </p>
  <p>
we all want something<br />
yet givers are few<br />
and sore <br />
and tired.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
when i read the giving tree<br />
i admired the concept of sharing yourself freely<br />
using your body to build<br />
but then what?<br />
leaves turn brown, branches break, wood splinters, <br />
people don't come back.<br />
</p>
  <p>
i don't want to be another stump for someone to sit on.<br />
i want to cultivate this old dirt<br />
grow new things, strengthen roots<br />
thicken the bark, protect the magnolia blossoms<br />
</p>
  <p>
maybe it won't work with the first seed i plant,<br />
or the second<br />
or the sixth. <br />
but i'll keep digging, watering, and tending.<br />
</p>
  <p>
when a wild flower grows from a teeny stray seed,<br />
my friend calls it a volunteer<br />
because no one asked it to bloom,<br />
yet here it stands, swaying in the breeze and adding color to the earth.<br />
</p>
  <p>
maybe i need to focus less on the fallowed land in front of me<br />
and more on the fields<br />
where new roots form everyday. <br />
</p>
  <p>
forget the giant's shoulders.<br />
let's climb a tree and reach the sun on our canopy.<br />
if you're trying to find the light,<br />
working with what you got<br />
is better than grasping at something<br />
that was never yours to start.<br />

This world is full of trash<br />
because people keep producing things<br />
with no plan for how they will biodegrade<br />
People keep buying things because<br />
  </p>
  <p>
Money makes people inconsiderate<br />
I had my students build towers<br />
out of paper cups and pipe cleaners<br />
One student started filling the cups with sand<br />
  </p>
  <p>
then all the other students started doing it<br />
the first student was upset - he said it was my idea<br />
so I should be the only one to make money off of it<br />
  </p>
  <p>
I told him that open-source laws allow you<br />
to make things public for learning, and reuse <br/>
but not for profit<br />
he said, "my ideas are mine"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
he was disappointed because all he had wanted<br />
to do was play soccer and not build towers<br />
  </p>
  <p>
"We don't have enough time to play"<br />
I asked, "can't building towers be playing"<br />
he replied no because it was a competition<br />
I asked "isn't soccer a competiton"<br />
and he just looks displeased as he was going home<br />
  </p>
  <p>
I want to tell him that in the desert they build houses<br />
out of tires filled with sand<br />
and that he was so smart, <br/>
that it's not wrong to want to play soccer<br />
but that it's not a game I like playing<br />
  </p>
  <p>
big system make for less personal agency<br />
he doesn't get to pick <br/>
what he's doing with his time<br />
  </p>
  <p>
Everyone's knees are skinned<br />
they're tired of listening<br />
One girl tells me that her teacher is mean<br />
that her teacher is just in it for the money<br />
  </p>
  <p>
Small systems work better<br />
we don't need money in small systems<br />
and we all need to give more<br />
each according to their ability<br />
  </p>
  <p>
We need to think about profit for the group<br />
not the individual, but in order for that to happen<br />
we need the right groups<br />
  </p>
  <p>
finding the right group seems almost impossible<br />
convincing the group that we no longer need money<br />
is even  more unlikely<br />
  </p>
  <p>
instead I focus on living within <br />
this broken system<br />
I want to practice growing food<br />
volunteers are nice we can't depend on them<br />
  </p>
  <p>
trees we can depend on<br />
we should plant more of them<br />
  </p>
  <p>
I spend so much time thinking <br/>
if we plant more trees the wars will stop<br />
we'll learn to share the space<br />
but it isn't true<br />
  </p>
  <p>
I can plant olive trees in the demilitarized zones<br />
I can pant orange trees under highways<br />
but people will continue to do damage to each other<br />
  </p>
  <p>
so maybe I've just resigned to keep planting seeds<br />
hoping to be pleasantly surprised<br />
  </p>
  <p>
soon the land in front of you<br/>
   will no longer be fallowed<br />
and overtime we can learn<br />
how to cultivate fields<br />
and treat the wounds <br/>
   that this system has caused<br />
  </p>
  <p>
Some trees are giants<br />
some trees you plant and never get the reward<br />
  </p>
  <p>
sometimes I dream about planting oak trees<br />
sometimes I think, that would be the perfect job<br />
  </p>
  <p>
though I'd never get to see the rewards<br />
someone else might<br />
your right -- working with what you got<br />
is all we can ever do<br />

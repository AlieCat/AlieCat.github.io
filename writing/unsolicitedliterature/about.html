            Dear Readers,
                </p>
                <p>
Glad you’re picking up our zine. <br/>

We write for self-expression, therapy, enjoyment, and so on, but ultimately we write for readers.<br/>

Thank you for humoring us.<br/>

The name Unsolicited Literature represents the fact that we want to impose our writing on individuals who may or may not have an interest in reading anything at the moment. Initially the idea was to low-key put issues in people’s mailboxes, but we learned that this is a violation of Section 1725 of Title 18 of the United States Code. Since we don’t yet have a phalanx of lawyers at our disposal, we decided we would still distribute our issues surreptitiously, but without involving mailboxes. So you may see our issues in unusual locations, sitting alone, and waiting for a reader.

We are a collection of students, ex-students, sex-ed teachers, classroom assistants, social workers, marketing strategy directors, music producers, environmental scientists, college radio DJs, and couch surfers, predominantly located in New Orleans. If you have art or literature that you want to share, please shoot us a message. We meet regularly to talk about our work (or lack of it) with each other. We'd love to have you involved as another node in the nexus. If you get us at the right time, there will be coffee. If you get us at the other right time, there will be whiskey.

Thanks again.
